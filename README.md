#Description
This project was created by me and a friend as a project for the course Advanced Web Programming together with @jessicakjellin. Below is our original idea for the project, which we think turned out quite well. 


Functional:
We want to make a webpage called BetterReads (inspired by GoodReads). Some functionalities we want to have: 

- Add books
- Search books 
    - Both books added by user and from API/public database of books. 
- Add books to bookshelves
- Have several different bookshelves. 
- Search for and add friends
- Write book review for books that are public. 
- Read and like other user's book reviews. 
- See your friends bookshelves. 

Technical: 
We want to use React and Django for the backend. We don't have that much experience in React or Django, but we think it is widley used in the indutry and 
feels like good technical tools to learn. From our research they also seem to work well together.
